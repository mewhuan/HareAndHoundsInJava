# HareAndHoundsInJava
A classic hard and hounds chess game. There are one Hare and three Hounds, hounds on the left and hare on the right. Hare can move to any neighbor square but hounds cannot move back. Hare wins if it can sneak cross the hounds to the left, hounds win by trapping the hare so that it cannot move any more. In addition, if hounds move vertically ten times in a row, hare wins.
AI provided with three difficulty levels.</br>
